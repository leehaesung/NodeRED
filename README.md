## What is Node RED?
 Node-RED is a visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things developed by IBM Emerging Technology and the open source community. Using Node-RED, developers wire up input, output and processing nodes to create flows to process data, control things, or send alerts. It works by allowing you to wire up web services or custom “nodes” to each other, or to things, to do things like:
* Send an email on a rainy weather forecast.
* Push sensor data to services like Twitter.
* Perform complex analysis on data with ease.
